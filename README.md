# x86-simd-sort

C++ template library for high performance SIMD based sorting routines for
built-in integers and floats (16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit data types) and custom
defined C++ objects. The sorting routines are accelerated using AVX-512/AVX2
when available. The library auto picks the best version depending on the
processor it is run on. If you are looking for the AVX-512 or AVX2 specific
implementations, please see
[README](https://github.com/intel/x86-simd-sort/blob/main/src/README.md) file
under `src/` directory. The following routines are currently supported:

## Sort an array of custom defined class objects (uses `O(N)` space)
``` cpp
template <typename T, typename U, typename Func>
void x86simdsort::object_qsort(T *arr, U arrsize, Func key_func)
```
`T` is any user defined struct or class and `arr` is a pointer to the first
element in the array of objects of type `T`. The `arrsize` parameter can be any
32-bit or 64-bit integer type. `Func` is a lambda function that computes the
`key` value for each object which is the metric used to sort the objects.
`Func` needs to have the following signature:

```cpp
[] (T obj) -> key_t { key_t key; /* compute key for obj */ return key; }
```

Note that the return type of the key `key_t` needs to be one of the following :
`[float, uint32_t, int32_t, double, uint64_t, int64_t]`. `object_qsort` has a
space complexity of `O(N)`. Specifically, it requires `arrsize * sizeof(key_t)`
bytes to store a vector with all the keys and an additional `arrsize *
sizeof(uint32_t)` bytes to store the indexes of the object array.  For
performance reasons, we recommend using `object_qsort` when the array size
is less than or equal to `UINT32_MAX`. An example usage of `object_qsort` is
provided in the [examples](#Sort-an-array-of-Points-using-object_qsort)
section.  Refer to [section](#Performance-of-object_qsort) to get a sense of
how fast this is relative to `std::sort`.

## Sort an array of built-in integers and floats
```cpp
void x86simdsort::qsort(T* arr, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
void x86simdsort::qselect(T* arr, size_t k, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
void x86simdsort::partial_qsort(T* arr, size_t k, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
```
Supported datatypes: `T` $\in$ `[_Float16, uint16_t, int16_t, float, uint32_t,
int32_t, double, uint64_t, int64_t]`

## Key-value sort routines on pairs of arrays
```cpp
void x86simdsort::keyvalue_qsort(T1* key, T2* val, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
void x86simdsort::keyvalue_select(T1* key, T2* val, size_t k, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
void x86simdsort::keyvalue_partial_sort(T1* key, T2* val, size_t k, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
```
Supported datatypes: `T1`, `T2` $\in$ `[float, uint32_t, int32_t, double,
uint64_t, int64_t]` Note that keyvalue sort is not yet supported for 16-bit
data types.

## Arg sort routines on arrays
```cpp
std::vector<size_t> arg = x86simdsort::argsort(T* arr, size_t size, bool hasnan, bool descending);
std::vector<size_t> arg = x86simdsort::argselect(T* arr, size_t k, size_t size, bool hasnan);
```
Supported datatypes: `T` $\in$ `[_Float16, uint16_t, int16_t, float, uint32_t, int32_t, double,
uint64_t, int64_t]` Note that argsort and argselect are not accelerated with SIMD when using 16-bit
data types.

## Build/Install

[meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) is the used build system. Command
to build and install the library:

```
meson setup --buildtype release builddir && cd builddir
meson compile
sudo meson install
```

Once installed, you can use `pkg-config --cflags --libs x86simdsortcpp` to
populate the right cflags and ldflags to compile and link your C++ program.
This repository also contains a test suite and benchmarking suite which are
written using [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [google
benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) frameworks respectively. You
can configure meson to build them both by using `-Dbuild_tests=true` and
`-Dbuild_benchmarks=true`.

## Build using OpenMP

`qsort`, `argsort`, and `keyvalue_qsort` can achieve even greater performance
(up-to 3x speedup) through parallelization with
[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/). By default, OpenMP support is disabled; to
enable it, set the `-Duse_openmp=true` flag when configuring Meson. If you are
using only the static SIMD implementations, compile with `-fopenmp
-DXSS_USE_OPENMP`.

OpenMP-based parallel sorting routines are used for arrays larger than a
specific threshold where threading makes sense. The number of threads is
limited to a maximum of 16.  You can control the number of threads by setting
the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.

## Using x86-simd-sort as a Meson subproject

If you would like to use this as a Meson subproject, then create `subprojects`
directory and copy `x86-simd-sort` into it. Add these two lines
in your meson.build.
```
xss = subproject('x86-simd-sort')
xss_dep = xss.get_variable('x86simdsortcpp_dep')
```

For more detailed instructions please refer to Meson
[documentation](https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html#using-a-subproject).

## Build with C-only API, targeting Windows and MSVC

The folder `make-c-api` contains a `Makefile` to build a shared library exporting only C-symbols.
This avoid potential conflicts of inconsistent mangling and calling convention across compilers.

Only a reduced set of functions are exported (`qselect`, `qsort`, `partial_qsort`, `keyvalue_qsort`, `keyvalue_partial_qsort`, `keyvalue_qselect`)
and only for a reduces set of types (`int32`, `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64`, `float`, `double`).

In the subfolder `make-c-api` a `Makefile` is provided which supports the following combinations of operating systems, compilers and targets:

```
+--------------+------------------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+
| Compilation  | Compiler         | Target     | Files Generated      | Build Command line  |
| Platform     |                  | Platform   |                      |                     |
+--------------+------------------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+
| LINUX        | g++              | LINUX      | libx86simdsort.so    | make                |
+--------------+------------------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+
| CYGWIN       | clang++          | CYGWIN     | libx86simdsort.so    | make                |
+--------------+------------------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+
| ANY          | mingw32 clang++  | Windows    | x86simdsort.dll      | make TARGET=DLL     |
|              |                  |            | x86simdsort.dll.lib  |                     |
+--------------+------------------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+
```

In all cases, exceptions and memory allocations never cross the shared library boundary.
In particular, if the target is a DLL, the library is self-contained, i.e. it does not depend on any other DLL.

Compilation is tested with clang 20 and gcc 15.

An include header `x86simdsort-c-api.h` and a `smoke.exe` executable test are also generated.

## Example usage

#### Sort an array of floats

```cpp
#include "x86simdsort.h"

int main() {
    std::vector<float> arr{1000};
    x86simdsort::qsort(arr.data(), 1000, true);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Sort an array of Points using object_qsort
```cpp
#include "x86simdsort.h"
#include <cmath>

struct Point {
    double x, y, z;
};

int main() {
    std::vector<Point> arr{1000};
    // Sort an array of Points by its x value:
    x86simdsort::object_qsort(arr.data(), 1000, [](Point p) { return p.x; });
    // Sort an array of Points by its distance from origin:
    x86simdsort::object_qsort(arr.data(), 1000, [](Point p) {
        return sqrt(p.x*p.x+p.y*p.y+p.z*p.z);
        });
    return 0;
}
```

## Details

- `x86simdsort::qsort` is equivalent to `qsort` in
  [C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_qsort.htm)
  or `std::sort` in [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort).
- `x86simdsort::qselect` is equivalent to `std::nth_element` in
  [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element) or
  `np.partition` in
  [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.partition.html).
- `x86simdsort::partial_qsort` is equivalent to `std::partial_sort` in
  [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/partial_sort).
- `x86simdsort::argsort` is equivalent to `np.argsort` in
  [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html).
- `x86simdsort::argselect` is equivalent to `np.argpartition` in
  [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argpartition.html).

Supported datatypes: `uint16_t, int16_t, _Float16, uint32_t, int32_t, float,
uint64_t, int64_t, double`. Note that `_Float16` will require building this
library with g++ >= 12.x. All the functions have an optional argument `bool
hasnan` set to `false` by default (these are relevant to floating point data
types only).  If your array has NAN's, the the behaviour of the sorting routine
is undefined. If `hasnan` is set to true, NAN's are always sorted to the end of
the array. In addition to that, qsort will replace all your NAN's with
`std::numeric_limits<T>::quiet_NaN`. The original bit-exact NaNs in
the input are not preserved. Also note that the arg methods (argsort and
argselect) will not use the SIMD based algorithms if they detect NAN's in the
array. You can read details of all the implementations
[here](https://github.com/intel/x86-simd-sort/blob/main/src/README.md).

## Performance comparison on AVX-512: `object_qsort` v/s `std::sort`
Performance of `object_qsort` can vary significantly depending on the defintion
of the custom class and we highly recommend benchmarking before using it. For
the sake of illustration, we provide a few examples in
[./benchmarks/bench-objsort.hpp](./benchmarks/bench-objsort.hpp) which measures
performance of `object_qsort` relative to `std::sort` when sorting an array of
3D points represented by the class: `struct Point {double x, y, z;}` and
`struct Point {float x, y, x;}`. We sort these points based on several
different metrics:

+ sort by coordinate `x`
+ sort by manhanttan distance (relative to origin): `abs(x) + abx(y) + abs(z)`
+ sort by Euclidean distance (relative to origin): `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)`
+ sort by Chebyshev distance (relative to origin): `max(abs(x), abs(y), abs(z))`

The performance data (shown in the plot below) can be collected by building the
benchmarks suite and running `./builddir/benchexe --benchmark_filter==*obj*`.
The data plot shown below was collected on a processor with AVX-512. For the
simplest of cases where we want to sort an array of struct by one of its
members, `object_qsort` can be up-to 5x faster for 32-bit data type and about
4x for 64-bit data type.  It tends to do even better when the metric to sort by
gets more complicated. Sorting by Euclidean distance can be up-to 10x faster.
